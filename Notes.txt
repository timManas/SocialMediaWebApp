Flow is 

Incoming: app.js
Outoung: app.js -> router.js
                        -> Goes to userController -> register() -> displays home-guest.ejs
                        -> Register: userController.js -> registers() -> users.js -> register() -> Adds onto MongoDB


0. Once you download NodeJs into your computer, you can run it on the command line by just typing 
"node applictationName"
Once we have node, then we can use npm to download frameworks like ExpressJS

00. function(req,res, next) is a middleware NodeJS that have access to request(req) and response(res) object
The req object contains a whole bunch of data about the request, such as parameters, queries, 
returned data from a form, cookies and more.

The res object is the response sent back to client, 
this might take the form of res.send, res.render, or res.redirect

====>>>>> IN OTHER WORDS. function(req,res,next) is a STANDARD when we work with servers

000. next - occurs after response is called. It is another middleware
1. How to launch/start the app ?
- From the root folder of this project
- Type in "node app"  or "node app.js"

2. How to set up Automatic App Update
    - Install nodemon "npm install nodemon"
    - Go to package.json
    - Add "watch": "nodemon app"
    - Run npm run watch

3. You will need to create a route
- Essentially, everytie you get a app.get() or app.post() you will be using a router to tell whhere to go
- Better for organization

4. "require(router.js)" has two functionalities 
i - Executes file inside its 
ii - Retunrs all the objects,variables, functions..etc  INSIDE that file which we can now use in the invoking class (ex. App.js)


6. Purpose of the Model
- Where business logic resides
- Ex. Password must be unique


5. Purpose of the Controller
- Accept input (network request) and convert requests into commands to be used by the Model 
- Depending on request, controller will call upon the appopriate Model / business logic

6. Connection to Database is done on db.js

7. Once we connect to the database THEN and ONLY THEN do we start listening for requests

8. We create db.js file and export the contents so we dont have to constantly "require" and create multiple instances
of the db 

9. Hence to get stuff from the db, you can just "require(db.js)" and you now have access to db capabilities for CRUD

10. Use dotenv (npm install dotenv) to encapsulate your db password

11. How to acces Env variables
- download dotenv
- create .env file
- create variable name  "CONNECTIONSTRING=XXX...."
- access it using process.env.CONNECTIONSTRING 


12. Remmeber its the Model and not the controller handling the business Logic
    - Hence we have created the "User.js" model


13. What is a Promise in JS ? 
- An object that represents the eventual completion of an asynchronous operation
- Has either Resolve or Reject


14. Promise vs Traditional Callback approach ?
Promises
- Allows us to chain asynchronous events for promises
- Much cleaner code

Callback 
- Code inside of code (Nested code)

15. The arrow funciton => Does NOT modify the "this" keyword


16. You can use "Await" keyboard to ensure that asychrnous functions are executed orderly
17. Await requires a "async" function to be run

18. Hash a password before storing into Database. Not the samething as Encrypting. One way conversation
- Useb bcryptJS to hash your password before storing

19. Once a user has logged on, the server has no memory of the user has already logged on
- Hence the server needs to "trust" the client once it has logged in
- We can use two solutions: Sessions or Tokens

20. Sessions uses cookies. They are unique for each browser(Chrome vs Firefox) which successfully logged in
- Session  info should be stored in MongoDB instead of the memory

21. We use flash to store any errors to the user if they logged incorrectly

22. You want validation on both side
- Server side for security
- Browser side for UX

23. Gravatar for setting up user Avatar

24. We only want logged in accounts to create post

25. We create the header.ejs file so that the Header is consistent,
We dont have to change the avatar everytime we create a page


26. You can use <% %> to do dynamic stuff using JS

27.
<% 'Scriptlet' tag, for control-flow, no output
<%_ ‘Whitespace Slurping’ Scriptlet tag, strips all whitespace before it
<%= Outputs the value into the template (HTML escaped)  ----- WE WANT TO OUTPUT SOMETHING IN JS
<%- Outputs the unescaped value into the template
<%# Comment tag, no execution, no output
<%% Outputs a literal '<%'
%> Plain ending tag
-%> Trim-mode ('newline slurp') tag, trims following newline
_%> ‘Whitespace Slurping’ ending tag, removes all whitespace after it


18. Theres two different types of /create-post
- One for GET and another for post
- Two are unique and independent from each other

29. insertOne is a asynchonous Operation. We have no idea how long it will take to store in DB
- We have two solutions, use then().catch() syntax or async keyword

30. When storing the Author, we DO NOT want to use the authors user name since they can modidy it,
- Instead, We want to use the _id from MongoDB for each unique user

31. Using <%> is a good way to add your content directly to the template

32. We use Lookup to find the originalId of the author

33. How does aggregate work ? 
- Aggregate works by letting us run multiple opertions
- Aggregate is not modifying any data in the database
- It is simply returning the data

34.  The : (ex. router.get("/profile/:") )  in the router URL makes it dynamic and doesent get added to the URL !!! 

35. userDoc = new User(userDoc, true)       // Set to true will get the avatar based on their email address


36. When you return a promise with resolve(somevalue), "somevalue" will appear on the "then(somevalue)". Similarly for error, it will appear 
for catch(error)

37. By the looks of it, any DB fetch requires a return of a promise. Hence a then() and catch() is required

38. When you do render(), you pass in the object with parameters to include in the <%= %>
        res.render("profile", {
            posts: posts,
            profileUsername: req.profileUser.username,
            profileAvatar: req.profileUser.avatar
        })

 39. <%= %>  - gets the object properties
 40. <% %>  - just exeuctes the code dynamically     

 41. Install Markdown (npm install marked) for some HTML slickness

 42. If you change <%= filterUserHTML(post.body) %> to <%- filterUserHTML(post.body) %>,
 Then the EJS will no longer project you and it will display as HTML TAGS


 43. We use "Sanitize-html" (npm install sanitize-html) to convert HTML into plain text
 44. However Markdown will add HTML tags

45. We use "Webpack" is a module bundler which bundles code together. We can place this bundle on the public folder

 45. We seperate the frontend JS with the backend JS
 46. Within the front-end JS folder, we created a module folder to host seperate files for new features
 47. We just want to export files that the main.js file will use
 - Need to install the following:
npm install webpack
npm install webpack-cli
npm install @babel/core
npm install @babel/preset-env
npm install babel-loader


48. Webpack.config.js stores the information on what folders we want to bundle together 
Hence we use webpack, it will look for this specific file

49. We use  "watch": "nodemon db --ignore frontend-js --ignore public/ & webpack --watch"
instead of just "watch": "nodemon db" because we want webpack to rebuild after every save. The & will help build
We also want to ignore the frontend-js and public folder 

50. For windows use:
 "watch": "start nodemon db --ignore frontend-js --ignore public/ && startwebpack --watch",


51. Babel converts our ultra modern JS code to more Traditional code that will work in older browser
52. Also  require() is NodeJS specific however the import is part of the traditional JS prog language

53. Javascript has no notion of classes or inheritance. Behind the scenes it is using prototypes
hence in JS, "class" is syntatic sugar =/ Regardless, even though you have "class" and "constructor" defined,
it will still use prototypes behind the scenes

54. When use # in query selector, it refers to the idea
ex. document.querySelector("#live-search-field")

55. When do we fire off a db search when they start typing in search ?
- We wait 5-7 seconds after they have stopped typing 



56. To send asynchous events to the server. We can use "fetch" or "axios" (npm install axios)


57. We create a new index on MongoDB
- We have one for id
- One for text 

58.  How to fetch the DB client
- Ex: const userCollection = require("../db")    // Reports the CLIENT anD NOT  the DB itself

59. If you are using <%%>, you are entiner EJS 

60. When you need to select a specifc Element # for id   . is for class


61. We install socket.io (npm install socket.io) in order to allow continous two way communication
between the browser and the server 


62. So now server is using socket.io, its going to make sure to use a JS designed from a web browser 
is available from this url ("/socket.io/socket.io.js"")


63. Handlers are fucked. Using "handler.call(this)" you will call the handler of the Object
Call is method available to functions.


64. CSRF - Cross Site Request Fogery
- Users type in the API call to the createpost or whatever 
- Caused by cookies 
- This type of attack see or access the account


65. API will be used to login,create post, modify and delete

66. Download POSTMAN to test the API !!!!


67. app.use(x()) - Runs this funciton for EVERY ROUTE !!!! 



68. Two ways of handling authentication
1. Sessions - which is currently already being used by the web app
2. Tokens - JSONWebTokens - INDUSTRY STANDARD

69. When we sign the token, we are trusting the token to be validation
The secret phrase encrypts the token and makes it valid 

70. Remmeber the key thing for API is that it sends the BASIC functionality
- Ex. jsut post
- Hence all responses coming back are in the form of JSON


71. Be mindful of CORS.
- Cross Origin Resource Sharing: Web browsers WILL NOT send Async requests to OTHER Domains 
UNLESS that domain says its ok to do so

72. Since we want our api to be available to everyone, we want to use the CORS package
- npm install cors


73. We create a ProcFile to push content to Heroku

74.Trying to push to Heroku ?
1. Login First 
- heroku login
2. Push all your code except env and node modules to github
3. Type this:
- heroku git:remote -a complexappsocialmedia
- git push heroku master
